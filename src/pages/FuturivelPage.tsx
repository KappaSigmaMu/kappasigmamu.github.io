              Gil started playing bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs and he met guitarist and singer{' '}
              <VelosoLink>Caetano Veloso</VelosoLink> at the Federal University of Bahia in 1963. The two began
              collaborating and performing together, releasing a single and EP.
              <br />
              <br />
              Along with Gal Costa, and Tom Zé, Gil and Veloso formed a collective on the landmark 1968 album
              <TropicaliaLink> Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses</TropicaliaLink>, whose style was influenced by The
              Beatles&apos; Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album Gil listened to constantly.
              <br />
              <br />
              Gil describes Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses as the birth of the tropicália movement. To him
              tropicália, or tropicalismo, was a conflation of musical and cultural developments that had occurred in
              Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s—primarily bossa nova and the Jovem Guarda (Young Wave) collective—with
              rock and roll music from the United States and Europe,
              <span color="white"> a movement deemed threatening by the Brazilian government of the time</span>.
              <br />
              <br />
              This apparent threat put Veloso and Gil in trouble.

              The military dictatorship in Brazil was established on 1 April 1964, after a coup d&apos;état by the
              Brazilian Armed Forces, with support from the United States government.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 1968 things became dangerous for free thinkers, when the Brazilian military dictatorship

              <br />
              <br />
              Among other things, the <ActFiveWikiLink>Institutional Act Number Five </ActFiveWikiLink>
              allowed the government to censor every medium of mass communication and art, criminalize political
              meetings that didn&apos;t have police authorization, limit anyone&apos;s right to gather and protest for
              up to ten years and even restore the death penalty
              <br />
              <br />
              On November 22, 1968, the Superior Council of Censorship was created, based on the American model of 1939.
              After this, Gil and Veloso became targets.

              In February 1969 Gil and Veloso were arrested by the Brazilian military government, brought from São Paulo
              to Rio de Janeiro.
              <br /> <br />
              They were given no reason or charge for their arrest.
              <br /> <br />
              Their heads were shaved and they were jailed in a solitary confinement wing, where they could hear the
              screams of other prisoners being tortured. They spent three months in prison and another four under house
              arrest, before being freed on the condition that they leave the country.

              Gilberto Gil wrote <FuturableLink>Futurível</FuturableLink> anticipating the cultural and technological

              On a seemengly unrelated note but around the same time, Yayoi Kusama releases her highly experimental
              short film:
              <SelfObliterationLink> Kusama&apos;s Self-Obliteration</SelfObliterationLink>.

              The artist used polka dots to cover and conceal people, animals, the environment, and everything around.
              It can be understood as a metaphor of giving up identity, abolishing uniqueness, and becoming one with the
              universe-or <i>self-obliteration</i>.
              <br />

              <CyborgManifestoLink>A Cyborg Manifesto</CyborgManifestoLink> was written by Donna Haraway in 1985.
              <br /> <br />
              The essay explores the concept of the cyborg and it&apos;s ramifications for the future, and effectively
              inaugurating the academic study of cyborgs.
              <br /> <br />
              The cyborg for Haraway can be understood as a metaphor for merging biology and technology. But more than
              that, it blurs the borders between the real and the imagined, also eliminating the division between the
              human body and other living beings; or between culture and nature itself.
              <br /> <br />
              <i>
                &#34;The cyborg is a dualism, as opposed to a dichotomy; there is value perceived in the confusion of
                the borders of bounded categories. The need for the divide between culture and nature is no longer
                relevant, and the cyborg emerges from the blending of that boundary.&#34;
              </i>
              - from <CyborgManifestoWikiLink>Wikipedia article</CyborgManifestoWikiLink> about the manifesto
              <br />
              <br />
              Again is unclear if Donna Haraway knew about Yayoi&apos;s Kusama and Gilberto Gil&apos;s early works, but
              they all shared the same subject.

              Some months later, the capalities of the Kusama Network were put to test with the launch of the Kusama
              Society, also known as Kappa Sigma Mu, which was founded by an anonymous member.
              <br /> <br />
              In technical terms, Kappa Sigma Mu is a collective created using the society pallet on Substrate, which in
              principle, is defined as an economic game incentivizing users to participate and maintain membership
              through rewards paid by the collective treasury. But in actuality, the Society is more than just that: It
              aims to make the Kusama network and its functionalities known to non-technical users, raise awareness of
              new forms of organization and identify the link between the onchain and offchain worlds.
              <br /> <br />
              THIS IS AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN HUMANS AND MACHINES.
              <br />
              We are a product of science and technology, we cannot distance ourselves from it. We can forge an alliance
              to embrace what technology can do for us and what we can do for others.
              <br /> <br />
              WE ARE PART HUMAN AND MACHINE.
              <br />
              We are part of hybrid networks living and reproducing in our bodies. The dichotomy of natural/artificial
              is no longer relevant in our times. We are here to understand how hybrid networks can help human
              development. We are cyborgs.
              <br /> <br />
              The Kusama Human Blockchain Project aims to forge an eternal alliance between human and machine, and to
              make this alliance tangible through the Kusama network. By joining the collective, we live in the machine
              and the machine lives in us. This is a social movement triggered by the immutable hash-chain as a concept,
              with the goal of erasing the division between human and machine. By erasing the division between both
              worlds, self-obliteration is achieved.

              Finally, our history converges to this unexpected partnership between Gilberto Gil and a digital society
              inspired by the Cyborg Manifesto and Yayoi&apos;s Kusama early work.
              <br /> <br />
              This project uses volumetric image capture techniques to generate a 3D model of Gilberto Gil, one of the
              greatest singer-songwriters of all time and an avid activist for open source technologies and free digital
              societies.
              <br /> <br />
              Through this project we celebrate Gilberto Gil&apos;s work on his 80th birthday creating an immortal and
              uncensorable symbolic memory on the Kusama blockchain.
              <br /> <br />
              His song Futurível comes full circle and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, Gilberto Gil is
              &#34;transmuted into energy&#34;, achieving self-obliteration.
              <br /> <br />
              We are Kappa Sigma Mu. We are cyborgs, a cyborg community. We are an alliance between humans and machine
              because happiness is made of metal.
              <br /> <br />
